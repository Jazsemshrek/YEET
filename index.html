  <h3>1. Go in crowded place</h3>
  <p>Despite the popular belief, it is safer and less likely to be caught if you take the child somewhere in public rather than when they are alone. 
    For example go in mall, a street or a festival.</p>
   <h3>2. Take the child</h3>
  <p>Grab him by his shirt and take him without anyone noticing.</p>
   <h3>3. Go home</h3>
  <p>a house</p>
   <h2>1. Congrats you did it</h2>
  <p>Now sell it on the black market.</p>
